The UK Food Standards Agency evaluates various establishments across the United Kingdom, and gives them a food hygiene rating. You've been contracted by the editors of a food magazine, Eat Safe, Love, to evaluate some of the ratings data in order to help their journalists and food critics decide where to focus future articles.

This repository contains the code and files for the Eat Safe, Love data analysis:

The Eat Safe, Love directory contains:

NoSQL_setup_starter.ipynb - Jupyter Notebook containing database setup and cleaning for analysis
NoSQL_analysis_starter.ipynb - Jupyter Notebook containing the database analysis based on project specifications
Resources directory - contains "establishments.json", which holds the raw restaurant data that was used to conduct the analysis.
